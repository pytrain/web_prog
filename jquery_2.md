  <h1>jQuery: Part II (Application/Project)</h1>
</center>

This lecture period will be used to apply our new knowledge of jQuery with all that we have already learned prior to the jQuery lecture.

Going back to our planetary website, we want to add a form at the bottom of the page in order to allow users to either send in comments or suggestions and to also add a planet.

1. Add a general form with necessary fields to add comments/suggestions and also to request that a planet be added to the list.
2. Include an entry field when the "request a planet" part has been selected to show a form field for the name of the planet.
3. When the user clicks the submit button, alert the user with a summary of their request.
4. Let's rewrite the code for changing the background color on hover of the first planet. Do this though in jQuery instead of pure Javascript.
5. Hide all planetary images until the section titles have been hovered over.
