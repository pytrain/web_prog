  <h1>PHP - Apache Interactions</h1>
</center>

Note: We covered a "server" interaction during the application/project lecture. [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) is a HTTP server where we "deploy" our PHP application upon. This server is the same as if we wanted to host a PHP project on a cloud-based service or on another physical server. This Apache server "interprets" PHP code if we have the proper bindings and PHP installed in addition to Apache. So, us running a local PHP server mimics Apache+PHP itself. There is a lot of configuration and setup to run an Apache server so we will not perform this locally.

So, another aspect of PHP that we can learn about is [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) which is a PHP application that manages [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) databases. There is an [online resource](https://demo.phpmyadmin.net) that allows us to use phpMyAdmin in order to create databases, tables, and populate these with data. In the next lecture, we will actually use a different online resource to connect to a MySQL database.

Let's explore some of phpMyAdmin: https://demo.phpmyadmin.net
