Project: 

1. Start with css bootstrap?
2. Sample and simple html5 page?
3. Javascript or jquery?
4. A form?
5. [https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-basic-html5-template/)
6. [https://html5boilerplate.com](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
7. [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/)

1. Download bootstrap projects and get only the starter template (includes css and Javascript). Can I build this iteratively?
2. What to change? Add drop down lists that represent certain choices. Form actions from php
3. What php functions do I want to see?
4. How do I teach html, css, and js as well?

upload instructions for a bootstrap dropdown menu

then upload instructions for multiple dropdown menus that are linked together (choose one → choices change for second one)

Not viable, but cool:
